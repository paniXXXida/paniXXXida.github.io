        <h3>Story of a product</h3>
        <p>
          In 1928, one of the first humanoid robots, Eric, was exhibited at the
          annual exhibition of the Model Engineers Society in London, where it
          delivered a speech. Invented by W. H. Richards, the robot's frame
          consisted of an aluminium body of armour with eleven electromagnets
          and one motor powered by a twelve-volt power source. The robot could
          move its hands and head and could be controlled through remote control
          or voice control.Both Eric and his "brother" George toured the world.
